Our team created an American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Detector to be used with the intention of learning the ASL alphabet. The application can then be applied in various ways such as teaching in a classroom or self teaching through a smartphone application. Our model will be built using various IoT applications, with the objective of ‘deploying’ the model on small devices such as a smartphone. This will be done by using the TensorFlow Lite framework. TensorFlow Lite is made specifically for the deployment of machine learning models on mobile and edge devices.
