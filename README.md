Our team created an American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Detector to be used with the intention of learning the ASL alphabet. The application can then be applied in various ways such as teaching in a classroom or self teaching through a smartphone application. Our model will be built using various IoT applications, with the objective of ‘deploying’ the model on small devices such as a smartphone. This will be done by using the TensorFlow Lite framework. TensorFlow Lite is made specifically for the deployment of machine learning models on mobile and edge devices.

Many different model optimization techniques will be applied to a custom CNN model architecture to compare the results against a more developed and complex model such as MobileNets. Optimization techinques include one-shot pruning, iterative pruning, weight clustering, and post-training quanization. The goal is to reduce model size significantly while maintaining or improving accuracy (and inference time). Final results can be seen at the end of the Jupyter Notebook file.
